			<h4>About me</h3>
			<p>I'm a 24 year old engineering student. I play the piano. I love classical music. I love coding. That's pretty much it.</p>
			<p style="font-size: .95em;">No, I'm not that boring in person, I just find it hard to present myself to other people.</p>
			<h4>About this site</h3>
			<p>It's really weird how this site came to be.</p>
			<p>I'm not going to say that I've wanted to code since I can remember. But I can safely say that I have been interested in coding for a very long time. I remember trying to make sense of Visual Basic when I was 12 years old and writing a small, bug-infested calculator. That <em>active</em> interest has dwindled in the coming years but I never lost my <em>passive</em> interest in programming and computer related things.</p>
			
			<p>Then, 7 years ago I got into a college (yes, it's been that long!). At my school, every freshman engineering student has to take an introductory C class. The course genuinely interested me but after a while my interest in C dwindled. Basically I found it hard to learn as a first language.</p>
			
			<p>For about 5 years after that introductory C course, I didn't write one single line of code. I kept on reading bits and pieces on blogs but I never wrote one line of code myself. I understood how a computer program works on a very basic level, but that was it. Two years ago, I got it in my head that I needed to learn how to program. And the original incident that made the idea got into my head is a pretty stupid one. I wanted to keep track of my progress on a certain site on an hourly basis but I had no idea how to do that. I kept asking around and everyone told me that it was a really easy script to write but they had no time at all. Yes, that made me learn how to program.</p>
			
			<p>I believe I was extremely lucky that I got excellent advice from people when I first started programming (the most recent start!). I was pretty intent on learning C or C++ (<em>real</em> programming languages to me at the time) but everyone I asked pointed me towards Python. I gave up in the end and started Zed Shaw's excellent <a class="contentlink" href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org">Learn Python the Hard way</a></strong>. In hindsight, I couldn't have had a better start, Python is an awesome language for a beginner.</p>
			
			<p>I can't tell enough good things about LPTHW. It's an excellent start to an excellent language which actually pushes you to do something. I've come to notice that most tutorials/guides give you code snippets to write and run. While that's all good and dandy, people (at least I) forget things that they don't use.</p>
			
			<p>Anyway, I started coding Python scripts in my everyday life. Even for stupid little things that don't need code. Come to think of it, there were times when I spent days (!) to code a script which would do a task that would only take 5 min if I'd done it by hand. Granted, I didn't know a lot about how to do most things in Python, but I'd like to think that those little snippets made me learn the most common patterns.</p>
			
			<p>About three months ago, I decided that I wanted to learn Django. I read the official tutorials, bought books. I could understand the backend parts without too much trouble (for the most part). But the frontend parts really baffled me. I had no idea how to make a site. I knew what CSS did but I had no idea how to write a stylesheet. I knew what JavaScript is used for but seeing other people's JS work still felt like black magic. It was apparent that I needed some HTML, CSS and JS training before really dipping into Django. </p>
			
			<p>Enter <a class="contentlink" href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I knew about Codecademy for a while now, but I didn't make an active effort to get something out of the site. Through HackerNews, I found about Code Year. I visited the site and I figured that I'd give a shot to their Web Fundamentals track. I have completed the track in about a week (which isn't that hard to do, especially if you know how to code in another programming language) but I felt that I'd forget everything I learned if I didn't try to make something out of it.</p>
			
			<p>I started writing html pages for my Python projects that would record what I've done to date and what my plans are to solve a specific problem for the current project. I had no plans to buy a domain and start serving content online, I was planning to do so in 5-6 months' time, after I had enough time to learn to innards of HTML, CSS and JS.</p>
			
			<p>Then, I read an article somewhere (can't remember where, I'll put up a link as soon as I find it), that basically told the reader that telling yourself that you'd tackle a certain project after you've learned X and Y and Z is just another way of procrastination. That article really got to me. It told the reader to go ahead and start doing something and figuring out the details as you along.</p>
			
			<p>So, here I am, with little knowledge of HTML and CSS, trying to come up with a website that could be potentially useful to people like me. I will share my experiences with the creation of this website, talk about which part of the code really bugged me, what I found online that helped me do X easily and what I came up with that made my job easier. I hope someone gets some use out of it.</p>
			
			<p>This site will be a constant work-in-process but I will always keep links to older implementations so people can understand how it got to where it is.</p>
			
			<p>Oh also, I can promise you that this site will <em>never, ever, ever</em> be plagued by ads and the like.</p>
