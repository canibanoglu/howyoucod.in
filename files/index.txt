					<p class="content">I'm not that good at making introductions, it took me 30 minutes to write this sentence. I'm arguing with myself to skip this part and just dive in to what I want to do. But even though I don't expect this site to be found by users, it's still a good idea to talk a little bit about what I want to do here.</p>
					
					<p class="content">Through this site, I will share my experiences with setting up a website, with the difficulties that I ran into while creating a certain page and I'll try to document here everything that I did.</p>
					
					<p class="content">The Internet is a great place. It's also a very overwhelming place. There are loads of great tutorials for how to create a website with [insert-framework-name-here] but sometimes following along these tutorials is extremely confusing. For myself, I sometimes get weird errors that is not even on the tutorial, sometimes I do something extremely stupid and forget to write something extremely trivial (hello infinite while loops!) or sometimes the content just doesn't make sense at the first hundred reads.</p>
					
					<p class="content">I will share my experiences on how this site is built over time. The site is a constant work-in-process. I will talk about what frustrated me, what helped me and some tricks that I find.</p>
					
					<p class="content">I hope someone finds the information here useful, if they ever visit this site.</p>
					
					<p class="content">So click over to the start here link if you want to see how this site was built.</p>
